# Wrath Of The Righteous Resource Unification
What is this?

It's a tool to merge different (game engine) instances of the same (tabletop rules) pool from different classes and make them behave correctly.

For instance, the default configuration merges Ki from Monk, Scaled Fist, and the mod-added Ninja class into one resource scaling with total level and the better of wis (if you have non-Scaled-Fist monk levels) and CHA if you have Scaled Fist or Ninja levels.

It does the same to Arcane Pool and Eldritch Pool.
