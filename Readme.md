# Wrath Of The Righteous Resource Unification
What is this?

It's a tool to merge different (game engine) instances of the same (tabletop rules) pool from different classes and make them behave correctly.

For instance, the default configuration merges Ki from Monk, Scaled Fist, and the mod-added Ninja class and Sacred Fist Warpriest Archetype into one resource scaling with total level and the better of wis (if you have non-Scaled-Fist monk levels) and CHA if you have Scaled Fist or Ninja levels.

It does the same to Arcane Pool and Eldritch Pool.

You can make it do the same to more resources by adding new entries in ResourceDefines.json using the existing ones as templates. Back up customized files before updating, please - it'll be overwritten at the moment.

It does absolutely nothing else.
